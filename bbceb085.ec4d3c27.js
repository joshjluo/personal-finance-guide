Even though the tradition focuses on children, generally family members will gift each other h\xf3ng b\u0101os to ring in the new year.

The amount of money in each h\xf3ng b\u0101o varied, but I appreciated the thought more than the money. I was always conservative with money, and I didn't really have anything to spend it on.

All this money was actually losing its value as time went on. I wasn't even earning the small amount of interest I would have gotten had I put my money in a savings account at a bank. The amount of money varied every year, but when I deposited whatever cash I had left (after using cash to pay for eating out in high school), it totaled around $4000. To make the math a little more simple, let's assume I received $400 every year or $33.33 every month for 10 years, and I invested that monthly $33.33 in a S&P 500 index fund with a low expense ratio which is expected to get 7% annual interest",Object(i.b)("sup",Object(n.a)({parentName:"p"},{id:"fnref-1"}),Object(i.b)("a",Object(n.a)({parentName:"sup"},{href:"#fn-1",className:"footnote-ref"}),"1")),".
