Welcome to the Personal Finance Guide! Before diving in, let's go over a brief introduction to make sure you know what you're reading.

## What is this?
The Personal Finance Guide is a consolidation of information from a variety of sources to help you manage your money. This step-by-step guide attempts to provide you with meaningful information while explaining any financial jargon in simple terms. 

## Who is this for?
This guide assumes zero prior knowledge and will hopefully help establish a foundation for financial literacy. This guide was created for people who have recently completed their full-time education, obtained a job earning income, and are relatively, if not fully, independent from their parents or legal guardians, but you are more than welcome to read through this if this does not describe you! This information is specific to the United States.

## Inspiration
I'm a recent college graduate who had (probably still has) no idea how to handle money, but I knew I wanted financial security in the future. I read a bunch of blog posts, forums, wikis, articles, etc. to try and educate myself, but I wished there was just a tutorial I could read through that would give me all the basics of what I needed to know step by step. Thus, the Personal Finance Guide was born. This is my attempt to hold myself accountable in learning about personal finance concepts while creating a useful resource for others.
