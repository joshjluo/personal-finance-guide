Even though the tradition focuses on children, generally family members will gift each other h\xf3ng b\u0101os to ring in the new year. Actually, just the other day, even though I am now an adult earning a full-time income, my older sister tried sending me money via Venmo for the New Year.

The amount of money in each h\xf3ng b\u0101o varied, but I appreciated the thought more than the money. I was always conservative with money, and I didn't really have anything to spend it on.

All this money was actually losing its value as time went on. I wasn't even earning the small amount of interest I would have gotten had I put my money in a savings account at a bank. The amount of money varied every year, but when I deposited whatever cash I had left (after using cash to pay for eating out in high school), it totaled around $4000. To make the math a little more simple, let's assume I received $400 every year or $33.33 every month for 10 years, and I invested that monthly $33.33 in a S&P 500 index fund with a low expense ratio which is expected to get 7% annual interest",Object(i.b)("sup",Object(n.a)({parentName:"p"},{id:"fnref-1"}),Object(i.b)("a",Object(n.a)({parentName:"sup"},{href:"#fn-1",className:"footnote-ref"}),"1")),".
